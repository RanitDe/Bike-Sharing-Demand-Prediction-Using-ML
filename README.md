This project aimed to predict the number of bikes required in a city on any given day, considering various factors like weather conditions, time of the year, and socio-economic factors.

Using a publicly available dataset from a bike-sharing service, I embarked on the following steps:

	1.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the data distribution, trends, and patterns. I discovered that weather conditions and seasonal variations significantly impacted bike demand.
	2.	Feature Engineering: Creating new features from the existing ones to improve the model’s predictive power. For example, I derived features like ‘day of the week’, ‘holiday indicator’, and ‘peak hours’.
	3.	Model Development: I experimented with several regression techniques, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting Machines.
	4.	Model Optimization: Fine-tuning hyperparameters to enhance model performance. The Gradient Boosting model showed the best results, with an R-squared value of around 0.88, indicating a strong correlation between the predicted and actual demand.

This project not only deepened my understanding of regression models but also demonstrated the importance of domain knowledge in feature engineering.
